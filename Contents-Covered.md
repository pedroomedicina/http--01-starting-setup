So in this module we learned a lot about sending HTTP requests from react. 

I learned that it works by sending Ajax requests and that it's best to use a package like axios. For axios, I learned how it worked and that I can set some default configuration at interceptors or even split the configuration with custom instances.

In the next module, we will also add some HTTP functionality to our burger builer project so that when we click that order button, we really send a request to our server to at least fake that we really placed an order.
